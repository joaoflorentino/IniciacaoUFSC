abstract = "A method for solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation is presented. The action of operators is calculated locally in coordinate and/or momentum representation. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to pass back and forth between coordinate and momentum representations, this transformation preserving all exact commutation relations. The time propagation is calculated by a Chebychev expansion of the time evolution operator. The accuracy and convergence properties of the method are investigated and compared with an exactly solvable model problem. Accurate converged results are obtained using a phase space boundary slightly exceeding the minimum theoretical value. Efficiency is attained by the natural vectorization options provided by the algorithm. A typical non-trivial application is presented, namely, the splitting up of the probability density of a non-pure state into transmitted and reflected branches due to scattering off a potential barrier.

At high pump power, a subfeature due to Autler-Townes splitting is observed that theoretical modeling shows is enhanced by Doppler averaging. Polarization spectroscopy provides a simple modulation--free signal suitable for laser frequency stabilization to excited state transitions.},

abstract ={Highly excited Rydberg atoms have many exaggerated properties. In particular, the interaction strength between such atoms can be varied over an enormous range. In a mesoscopic ensemble, such strong, long-range interactions can be used for fast preparation of desired many-particle states. We generated Rydberg excitations in an ultra-cold atomic gas and subsequently converted them into light. As the principal quantum number n was increased beyond ∼70, no more than a single excitation was retrieved from the entire mesoscopic ensemble of atoms. These results hold promise for studies of dynamics and disorder in many-body systems with tunable interactions and for scalable quantum information networks.},

We have observed the decay of nD + nD quasi-molecules by detecting the products in the ( n +2)P state after pulsed excitation for 29≤ n ≤41. The decay rate can be manipulated with a dc electric field and requires a consideration of the multilevel nature of the process to explain the observations. The time dependence of the ( n +2)P signal is found to support a time-dependent picture of the dynamics.}

  abstract={We have measured the radiative lifetimes of n s, n p and n d Rydberg states of rubidium in the range 28 ≤ n ≤ 45. To enable long-lived states to be measured, our experiment uses slow-moving (~100 µK) 85 Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Two experimental techniques have been adopted to reduce random and systematic errors. First, a narrow-bandwidth pulsed laser is used to excite the target n ℓ Rydberg state, resulting in minimal shot-to-shot variation in the initial state population. Second, we monitor the target state population as a function of time delay from the laser pulse using a short-duration, millimetre-wave pulse that is resonant with a one- or two-photon transition to a higher energy 'monitor state', n 'ℓ'. We then selectively field ionize the monitor state, and detect the resulting electrons with a micro-channel plate. This signal is an accurate mirror of the n ℓ target state population, and is uncontaminated by contributions from other states which are populated by black body radiation. Our results are generally consistent with other recent experimental results obtained using a method which is more prone to systematic error, and are also in excellent agreement with theory.}

  abstract={One-dimensional velocity-selective coherent population trapping (VSCPT) in a cascade atomic configuration, with the second excited level a Rydberg state, is investigated through numerical calculations. The trapping efficiency for the case of travelling wave lasers is derived from the solution of the optical Bloch equations. For excitation by bichromatic standing waves, the energy-band approach is applied. Although the cooling process is limited by the spontaneous emission decay of the Rydberg state, the coexistence of polarization-gradient cooling and VSCPT in the case of standing waves allows the preparation of the majority of the atomic population in a cold Rydberg state.}

The advantage of this four-step scheme is that the final transition to the Rydberg state has a large dipole moment and one can achieve similar Rabi frequencies to two- or three-step excitation schemes using two orders of magnitude less laser power. This scheme enables new applications such as dephasing free Rydberg excitation. The observed lineshapes are in good agreement with simulations based on multilevel optical Bloch equations.},

  abstract={We consider the excitation of Rydberg states through photons carrying an intrinsic orbital angular momentum degree of freedom. Laguerre–Gauss modes, with a helical wave-front structure, correspond to such a set of laser beams, which carry ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/49/7/074007/jpbaa1828ieqn1.gif] {${{\ell }}_{0}$} units of orbital angular momentum in their propagation direction, with ℓ 0 the winding number. We demonstrate that, in a proper geometry setting, this orbital angular momentum can be transferred to the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, thus violating the standard dipole selection rules. Higher orbital angular momentum states become accessible through a single photon excitation process. We investigate how the spacial structure of the Laguerre–Gauss beam affects the radial coupling strength, assuming the simplest case of hydrogen-like wavefunctions. Finally we discuss a generalization of the angular momentum coupling, in order to include the effects of the fine and hyperfine splitting, in the context of the Wigner–Eckart theorem.}
